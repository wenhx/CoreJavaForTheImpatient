Synchronization on a new ReentrantLock object:
The `synchronized` keyword is used to acquire a lock on an object to ensure exclusive access to a block of code.
In the given code, a new `ReentrantLock` object is created within the `synchronized` block,
which means that each thread calling the `push` method will acquire a lock on a different lock object.
This will result in no synchronization at all since each thread will have its own lock and won't block each other.
To properly synchronize the code, a shared lock object should be used.
