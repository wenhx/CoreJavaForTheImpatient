The code snippet provided seems to have a potential issue with synchronization.
The `synchronized (values)` block is used to ensure that only one thread can access the shared `values` array at a time.
However, the problem is that the `values` array is being reassigned inside the synchronized block,
which can lead to unexpected behavior.

When the line `values = Arrays.copyOf(values, 2 * size);` is executed,
a new array is created, and the reference to this new array is assigned to the `values` variable.
This means that any other threads waiting to enter the synchronized block will still be using the old array reference.
After a new array is assigned to the 'values' variable, a new thread may immediately enter the critical section.
As a result, those threads will not see the updated `values` array,
leading to potential data inconsistency or incorrect behavior.
